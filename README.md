# Olympus Navigator - Discord Bot for Disney Sorcerer's Arena Players

Olympus Navigator is a Discord bot I developed to support players of Disney Sorcerer's Arena. As one of my initial ventures into JavaScript, this project was both a learning experience and a means to offer utility to the gaming community. The bot aids server members in tracking their in-game progress, setting specific goals, and providing insights tailored for the game.

### Serving the Disney Sorcerer's Arena Community

Built using JavaScript and the Discord API, the Olympus Navigator offers prompt responses to player commands. With its integrated MySQL database, it securely stores and fetches in-game data, allowing players to access essential stats and insights on demand.

The bot was crafted not only as a coding challenge but also to be a practical tool for the community. It simplified the process for players to manage their game data and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts. At its peak, it was actively used by over 50 players, underscoring its utility and relevance within the community.
